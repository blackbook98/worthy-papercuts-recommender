# Worthy Papercuts 📚

A full-stack book tracking and discovery platform with AI-powered recommendations and an intelligent conversational assistant. Users can search for books, manage reading lists, and rate and review titles. Built as a portfolio project to showcase microservice architecture, machine learning integration, and modern AI agent development.

## Overview

The interesting part of this project is not just the features — it's the deliberate engineering decisions behind them.

Rather than building a monolith, the system is split into three independently deployable services: a NestJS API, a Python ML microservice, and a React frontend. Recommendations are decoupled from the request cycle entirely — pre-computed on a schedule and served instantly from the database. The AI chatbot is implemented as a proper tool-calling agent rather than a simple prompt wrapper, giving it the ability to take real actions on a user's behalf.

The stack was chosen to reflect real-world trade-offs:

- **NestJS + TypeScript** for a structured, scalable backend with clear module boundaries
- **React** for a lightweight frontend that calls Google Books API directly, keeping book search out of the backend
- **Python + scikit-learn** for the ML layer — keeping data science concerns out of the Node service
- **Google ADK + Gemini** for an agent that reasons over tools rather than just generating text
- **PostgreSQL on Neon.tech** for a serverless-friendly managed database

## Features

### Core

- 🔐 JWT authentication — register, login, logout
- 📚 Search for books via Google Books API
- 📋 Save books to lists — **To Read**, **Reading**, **Finished**
- 🔄 Move books between lists
- ⭐ Rate and review finished books
- 🔍 Search and filter within your own lists
- 👥 View other users' ratings and reviews on book detail pages

### AI Features

- 🤖 **AI Book Recommendations** — personalized suggestions powered by a Python ML microservice using content-based filtering. A taste profile is built from your rated books: description keywords extracted via TF-IDF (higher-rated books contribute more), authors scored by peak rating with a small bonus for multiple reads, and genres weighted by cumulative rating. Candidate books from Google Books API are scored via TF-IDF cosine similarity against the profile (keywords weighted 4×, authors and genres 1× each). Each query contributes at most 4 candidates to keep the pool balanced. Recommendations are pre-computed and served instantly from the database
- 💬 **AI Chatbot Agent** — powered by Google ADK and Gemini. Can search for books, add them to your lists, move or remove books across lists, and discuss literary topics conversationally

### Request Flow — Recommendations

```
Scheduled job (every 12 hours)
        │
        ▼
Backend (NestJS) fetches user's finished books + ratings from DB
        │
        ▼
POST to Python /recommend
        │
        ▼
Python extracts taste profile:
  - Keywords: TF-IDF over descriptions, higher-rated books repeated more
  - Authors: peak rating + 0.5× bonus per additional read (threshold ≥ 0.8)
  - Genres: cumulative rating weight (threshold ≥ 1.0)
Builds search queries → hits Google Books API (max 4 results per query):
  - Top author → inauthor: query
  - Top keywords → free-text query
  - Keywords + genre → blended query (or subject: fallback)
Scores all candidates via TF-IDF cosine similarity
  (keywords ×4, authors ×1, genres ×1 in profile vector)
        │
        ▼
Returns top 10 books → Backend saves to recommendations table
        │
        ▼
User hits GET /recommendations → instant response from DB ⚡
```

### Request Flow — AI Chatbot

```
User: "Add Dune to my reading list"
        │
        ▼
POST /chatbot/message → NestJS ChatbotService
        │
        ▼
Google ADK Agent (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
  → calls search_books tool (Google Books API)
  → confirms book with user
  → calls add_book_to_list tool (directly hits ListsService)
        │
        ▼
"Done! I've added Dune by Frank Herbert to your To Read list."
```

## Planned Features for next Iteration

- **Collaborative filtering** — cross-user recommendations once the platform has sufficient rating data
- **User profile page** — reading stats, favourite genres, reviews written
- **Book exchange system** — match users within 10km who want to exchange books, using PostGIS geospatial queries
- **Reading pace tracker** — log reading sessions and predict finish dates
